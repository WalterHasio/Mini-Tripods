Small printable tripod, the folding legs are designed to print in one piece without supports.  This is a challenging print and may be difficult with some printers.
There are several mounting options, a standard 1/4-20 tripod mount, a hotshoe mount, and a phone mount (the phone mount works best with phones that have a centered audio jack since there's nothing that prevents it from rotating).  The ball part of the ballhead is threaded, so try to get the threads aligned before screwing it on to avoid stripping the threads.

Warning: Using the audio jack as a tripod mount may damage your phone.

Parts List:

1/4-20 x 3/8 Hex Bolt [ebay]* - for attaching the ball head to the tripod legs and for the 1/4-20 mount (for attaching the ballhead, longer bolts can work).
M4 x 50mm Hex Bolt [ebay]* - for the ballhead clamp
M4 Nut [trimcraftaviationrc] - for the knob
audio plug [ebay]* - phone mount only
The link to the bolt are for quantities of 100/50 (which is what I ordered), If you only need a few, Bolt Depot may be a good option.
